# Page Guard for Umbraco

Page Guard allows users to easily check out specific pages for exclusive editing rights. By checking out a page, you prevent others from making simultaneous changes, reducing the risk of content conflicts and data loss. Once you've made the necessary updates, simply check the page back in to make it available for others to edit.

## Supported Versions

- Umbraco 11.4+

## How to Install

To add the check in / check out functionality to your page, you will need to add the Data Type **Page Guard: Status** to your required Document Types in the Settings section of the Umbraco CMS backoffice.

## Languages

This package is available in English, Danish, German, French and Dutch. Please note, the translations were generated by an online translator so they may not be wholly accurate.
